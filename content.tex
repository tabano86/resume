% Summary
\noindent
Staff-caliber platform engineer who started career solving reliability problems for military helicopters and brings that systems thinking to software at scale. I architect platforms that let multiple teams ship independently---monorepos, micro-frontends, workflow orchestration, and governance guardrails that make releases boring. Led platform consolidation across 15+ teams at a Fortune 5 healthcare org, shipped greenfield insurtech infrastructure at Swiss Re, and built data systems that kept Black Hawks mission-ready.
